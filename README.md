# What is the M3tering protocol

In a nutshell, `M3tering` is a _token incentivized protocol_ with the objective of driving capital investment in solar energy projects to electrify underserved regions, especially in Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, by incentivizing individuals and institutions to become electricity providers through on-site rooftop solar installations PPAs.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Not familiar with PPA:** A Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) is a contract between someone who produces electricity, and a someone else that wants to buy that electricity. The producer agrees to sell the electricity they generate at a set price to the buyer for a specific period, like 5 years. It helps the producer earn money while the buyer gets a steady supply of clean power. Learn more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power\_purchase\_agreement).
{% endhint %}

The protocol's success hinges on its capacity to provide a reliable, clean, and cost-effective source of electricity through decentralized solar installations, thereby positively impacting the lives of millions while promoting community ownership of the energy infrastructure. Ultimately, the M3tering Protocol aims to contribute to social and economic development by providing a reliable supply of electricity to productive users and promoting sustainable energy solutions for public good.

Consumers pre-pay for clean electricity using DAI stablecoins, and providers receive rewards in protocol tokens. Through network effects, the protocol fosters the growth of electrification services, driving capital expenditure into sustainable infrastructure projects and promoting cleaner energy access in the global south.
