# The Offtaker side

In the M3tering Protocol, the offtaker is typically a commercial buildings, but could also be a household, utility, or any entity with electricity demand that wants to procure clean energy from the decentralized solar energy providers within the protocol. To access the clean electricity, the offtaker pre-pays for the energy in DAI. &#x20;

The price of electricity per unit (kWh) for an offtaker, also known as the tariff, is typically decided in the power purchase agreement and encoded in the M3tering smart contract. When the offtaker pre-pays, the smart contract calculates the maximum amount of energy they can consume before needing to pay again, based on the agreed-upon tariff. The M3ter then supply power to the offtaker accordingly.

While the typically role of the offtaker in the protocol is electricity consumption, they could also have an additional role locations where net metering or feed-in tariffs are in place. In such locations, the offtaker can send excess energy into to the grid and receive credits or discounts on their utility bill. This creates an opportunity for them to benefit from a price arbitrage between their M3tering tariff and the feed-in tariff from the utility, all while contributing to a cleaner electricity grid.
